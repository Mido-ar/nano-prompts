# Nano Banana Architecture Prompt Builder

An interactive tool to build architectural prompts by selecting a category and iteratively choosing options for its variables, generating a complete, ready-to-use prompt string. This application is designed to help architects, designers, and students quickly generate detailed prompts for AI image generation models like Google's Gemini (specifically the 'Nano Banana' model variant).

## Features

- **Categorized Prompts**: Prompts are organized into three main categories: Architecture, Interior Design, and Urban Design.
- **Dynamic Prompt Generation**: Select a category and a specific sub-category (e.g., "Luxurious Residential Villa Rendering") to load a prompt template.
- **Interactive Variables**: Customize the prompt using intuitive controls like dropdowns, multi-select checkboxes, and color pickers.
- **Real-Time Updates**: The generated prompt updates instantly as you make selections.
- **Powerful Search**: Quickly find specific prompt templates by searching for keywords like 'villa', 'kitchen', or 'CAD'.
- **Easy Export**:
    - **Copy to Clipboard**: Instantly copy the generated prompt with a single click.
    - **Open in AI Studio**: A direct link to open a new chat in Google AI Studio with the correct model pre-selected.
- **Utility Functions**:
    - **Randomize**: Quickly generate a new prompt with random variable selections.
    - **Clear All**: Reset all selections for the current template.
- **User-Friendly Interface**:
    - Light & Dark mode support.
    - Responsive design for various screen sizes.
    - Built-in help section to guide new users.

## How to Use

1.  **Choose a Main Category**: Start by selecting either Architecture, Interior Design, or Urban Design from the main screen.
2.  **Select a Prompt Subcategory**: On the generator screen, use the dropdown to choose a specific task or template (e.g., "Sketch to 3D Model").
3.  **Fill in the Variables**: Use the controls to make selections for each variable. The generated prompt on the right will update in real-time. You can hover over a variable name to see a helpful tooltip.
4.  **Use Your Prompt**: Once you're happy with the result, click the **Copy** button. Then, you can use the **Open in Google AI Studio** link to paste your prompt and generate your image.
